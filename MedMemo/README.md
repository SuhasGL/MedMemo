# MedmemoApp
The Medmemo app is focused on giving users the facility to store their medicines with the expiry date, set an alarm reminder for their medicine and explore the uses of various medicines. 
The purpose of “Medmemo” is to automate the existing manual system, so that their valuable data can be stored with easy accessing and manipulation.
